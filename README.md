# inFridge

## Project overview

The purpose of this app is to help and fill any hungry belly out there. The app connects to a Google Sheet file. The file stores favorite recipes and infridge ingredients. The app generates a recipe based on infridge ingredients or a shopping list if no recipe is available.

inFridge is for everyone who cooks. From students, single parents, busy professionals to kids who want to surprise their parents or grandparents.

Instead of wasting hours thinking what to cook for the day, just ask the computer what can you cook with what you have in the fridge.

## User Stories

Although this is a CLI app it doesn't address only to tech savvy people, because it was designed with user interaction in mind.

### As developer

- I want to offer a solution to an everyday problem to help users choose a meal
- I want the user to get a shopping list if a recipe is not available so that the user can still enjoy a favorite recipe
- I want to offer feedback to user input to guide the user through the process of using the app

### As a user

- I want an easy to use app to avoid frustration
- I want information on each step to understand what to do
- I want to be able to choose one of may favorite recipes to enjoy a meal
- I want to be able to choose recipes based on an ingredient I fancy to save time sorting through my favorite recipes list
- I want be able to add or remove ingredients so that I have an up to date in fridge ingredients list

## Features

In this section, you can find implemented features as well as some features left for a future development stage.

### Existing Features

#### Welcome screen

Welcomes user and explains what can be done and how.

![Welcome screenshot](assets/images/welcome.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Choosing and validating basic ingredient

A basic ingredient can be choose only if the ingredient already exists in the spreadsheet and input validation is passed.

![Basic ingredient](assets/images/basic-ingredient-validation.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Recipes list

A list of recipes is generated based on chosen ingredient after correct validation.
This list is printed with option numbers for each recipe so that the user can easily chose wich recipe to try.

![Recipes list](assets/images/recipe-list.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Print recipe

If chosen recipe has all ingredients infridge it will be printed in a user friendly format. This is a potential app ending, so the a nice "Good bye!" message is displayed to inform the user.

![Print recipe](assets/images/print-recipe.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Remove ingredients

When the chosen recipe is successfully printed the ingredients quantities are automatically removed from the spreadsheet to keep the document up to date.

![Remove ingredients](assets/images/print-recipe.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Shopping list

If a recipe is not available the user can choose to see a shopping list.
Requesting a shopping list doesn't alter the spreadsheet in any way. The user will have to go through the process again in order to add the missing ingredients after shopping and again to remove the used ingredients. This leaves room for improvement...

![Shopping list](assets/images/shopping-list.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

#### Add ingredients

If a recipe is not available the user can choose to add ingredients.
This will update the spreadsheet. If an ingredient already exists its quantity will be updated. If an ingredient is new its name and quantity will be added as a new row in the ingredients worksheet.

![Add ingredients](assets/images/add-ingredients.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

### Future Features

#### Add ingredients menu option

Add ingredients feature already exists, but it comes at the end of the app as part of the user's guiding process. It would be better used as a menu option at the beggining of the app.

#### Add recipe

This will be a good addition to the app especially if the app evolves from CLI to GUI. It wasn't implemented at the time of the submission because the app usses a spreadsheet and it's easier for the user to add the data in the spreadsheet.

#### Real quantities

At the moment the ingredients quantities don't have measurement units. Each quantity is represented by a integer number. This can be improved.

#### Other features

The app can be expanded in quite a few ways:

- add drinks recipes
- add meal categories
- add ingredients expiry date
- add calories tracker

## Flowchart

## Data Model

Google Sheets was used to store data in a spreasheet called infridge with two worksheets.

**Recipes worksheet** contains all recipe data. In the first column is recipe name, followed by a number of ingredient cells. In the last cell is the cooking method.

This worksheet has 50 rows and 26 columns, manual expansion is posible from spreadsheet.

![Recipes worksheet](assets/images/recipes.jpg)

**Ingredients worksheet** contains all ingredients data. The first column is for ingredient name and the secon is for ingredient quantity.

This worksheet has 100 rows and 26 columns, expansion is done automatically when updating ingredients.

**Important** At the time of submission "chicken" ingredient was set on 0 for testing, so that each chicken recipe will be unavailable.

## Testing

Testing was done manualy at the creation of each feature or function.

Print statements were used extensively to show different values for variables, functions or to see just general outcome.

Print statements were also used throughout the project as placeholders for future functions or in newly created functions to check function calling.

### [PEP8 validation](http://pep8online.com/)

PEP8 code validation passed with no errors, although there is a Flake8 warning in Gitpod for setting global scope to a variable. Any other Flake8 errors or warnings were fixed.

![PEP8 validation](assets/images/validation.jpg)

[Back to top](#Table-of-contents)

### Bugs found

- **Capitalized ingredient** were ignored by validation, so lower() method was used on basic ingredient user input

![Capitalized ingredient](assets/images/bug-lower.jpg)

- **Empty string** user feedback was not included initially in basic ingredient validation, so a new feedback message was added

- **Last entry omission** - generate available recipes list didn't show the last recipe so the range for generating the list was changed
