# inFridge

## Project overview

The purpose of this app is to help and fill any hungry belly out there. The app connects to a Google Sheet file. The file stores favorite recipes and infridge ingredients. The app generates a recipe based on infridge ingredients or a shopping list if no recipe is available.

inFridge is for everyone who cooks. From students, single parents, busy professionals to kids who want to surprise their parents or grandparents.

Instead of wasting hours thinking what to cook for the day, just ask the computer what can you cook with what you have in the fridge.
